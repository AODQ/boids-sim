# boids-sim
A real-time boid simulator using raymarched SDFs. Not at all physically accurate.
It's more or less just an excuse for me to play around with terrain generation and faking details.
The textures I use in the texture folder, mostly to generate terrain, normal maps, displacements, etc. are free textures from http://www.art.eonworks.com/free/textures/free-textures-01.html .
Except for, of course, the noise texture
